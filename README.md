Makerville Knit
===

This repo hosts the hardware design files as well as Knit specific documentation (wip).

## Hardware
If you would like to check out the schematic and layout files, along with other associated resources, head over to the [hardware/Knit](https://github.com/Makerville/knit/tree/master/hardware/Knit) folder. We have used KiCad 4.0 to design the boards. You can find instructions on how to install it for your OS [here](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/)

## Software
All the required software for Knit is hosted on [Marvell's GitHub SDK](https://github.com/marvell-iot/aws_starter_sdk/).
